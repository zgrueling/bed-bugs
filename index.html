			<p> From rats to roaches, New York City has no shortage of pests. But <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/here-are-the-worst-pest-infestations-in-nyc-ranked">arguably the most hated</a> of all are bed bugs. The blood-sucking insects, which fully grown resemble apple seeds in shape and color, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vector/bed-bug-guide.pdf">can live in the seams of mattresses</a> and other upholstered furniture, as well as in the baseboards of walls. <i>Cimex lectularius</i> typically emerge at night to feed on their human hosts, and their bites can leave <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vector/bed-bug-guide.pdf">itchy or painful welts</a>.
			</p>

			<p> While reduced travel during the covid-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/well/live/coronavirus-bedbugs.html">may have granted New Yorkers some reprieve from the pest,</a> the city still recorded <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Bedbug-Reporting/wz6d-d3jb">3,955 reports of bed bug infestations</a> in 2020 alone. The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Bedbug-Reporting/wz6d-d3jb">tracks reports of infestations,</a> which are <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/bedbugs.page">required annually of multi-unit property owners.</a> Analysis of the data reveals a more complicated distribution than one determined solely by population density.

			<p> Bed bugs are not known to spread disease, but an infestation is a nuisance and can cause extreme psychological distress.* Eradication can also impose a significant financial burden. Individual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/health/11patient.html">families commonly spend up to $5000</a> on ridding their home of the pest, while landlords of large buildings may pay <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/health/11patient.html">as much as $80,000</a>.
			</p>

			<p> In NYC, property owners are <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/bedbugs.page">required by law to promptly address</a> bed bug infestations. If their landlord fails to take appropriate actions, tenants should call 311 or <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/">file a complaint online</a>.
